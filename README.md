# ALU-Design-Using-Verilog-HDL
Overview

This project implements a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog HDL. The ALU is designed using a hierarchical approach, where complex functionality is built from smaller reusable modules such as Full Adders, a Ripple Carry Adder, Arithmetic Unit, Logic Unit, and Shift Unit.

The design supports arithmetic, logical, and shift operations along with status flag generation commonly used in processor architectures.

Features
Arithmetic Operations
Addition (A + B)
Subtraction (A - B) using Two's Complement arithmetic
Logical Operations
AND
OR
XOR
NOT
Shift Operations
Logical Left Shift
Logical Right Shift
Status Flags
Zero (Z) – Set when result equals zero
Carry (C) – Indicates carry-out from arithmetic operations
Negative (N) – Indicates negative result (MSB = 1)
Overflow (V) – Indicates signed arithmetic overflow

Simulation and Verification

The ALU was verified using dedicated Verilog testbenches covering:

Arithmetic operations
Logical operations
Shift operations
